# EtherNaut


## Description

Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

This repo contains my solutions to the Ethernaut challenges, implemented in Solidity.

## Features

- Solutions for all levels of the Ethernaut CTF
- Well documented Solidity code walking through the exploit for each level
- Deployment scripts and instructions for testing the exploits locally
- Explanations of the vulnerabilities in each level and how they are exploited
- Example interfaces, scripts, and tests for interacing with each level's contract
- Tutorial style writeups for anyone looking to learn Ethereum security and Solidity

Let me know if you would like me to expand on any part of the features or description! I focused on highlighting that this contains solutions for all Ethernaut levels, with details on how the exploits work.
